# investigation-on-low-weight-babies
This is the final project of course Advanced Data Analysis. We studied on the influence of several factors on infants' weight, using linear regression models, logistic regression models.

Summary:

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between maternal age and birth weight, as well as
to provide the insight of how other factors affect newborn babies’ birth weights. In this project, first, we
select potential variables by conducting statistical tests, then build linear regression and logistic regression
models based on Cp, AIC, BIC and cross validation methods, and finally select the best 2 models for birth
weight prediction and low birth-weight determination. Our results show that factors such as weight gained,
gestation period, plurality, marital status, maternal smoking and maturity have huge impact on causing the
risk of low birth-weight. In addition, we have also demonstrated that advanced maternal age appears to
contribute less risk in low birth-weights of newborns’.
